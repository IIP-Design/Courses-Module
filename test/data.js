Estimate the timeline for raising capital.]<\/p>\n<p>[TEXT: Evan Burfield, Co-Founder, 1776]<\/p>\n<p>How to raise capital.<\/p>\n<p>There are three learning objectives for this module \u2014 identifying the types of capital, understanding the process of engaging investors, and estimating the timeline for raising capital.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the most common question that new entrepreneurs ask is, \u201cHow do I raise capital?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the unsatisfying answer is that when your business is ready, it\u2019s actually not that hard to raise capital. And if your business isn\u2019t ready, then it can be almost impossible. With that said, there are definitely more effective ways to go about the process of raising capital.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most important things to understand before you start to raise capital is the different types of capital that may be available to your business depending on the type of business, the maturity of the business and the market in which you operate.<\/p>\n<p>If you have an idea, but have yet to build a product or have any real usage that can validate your business model, then you\u2019re probably looking for friends and family to invest in you.<\/p>\n<p>Friends and family doesn\u2019t literally mean only your friends or family members. It means that you\u2019re approaching people with whom you have a trusted relationship and asking them to believe in you \u2014 with minimal evidence that you\u2019ll be successful other than their prior experiences with you. One of the unfair elements of life is that some entrepreneurs have access to friends and family with a lot more capital than other entrepreneurs. Regardless, for almost every entrepreneur, the money you raise from your friends and family is precious, so make sure you spend it carefully.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a product \u2014 or at least a working prototype \u2014 and strong evidence that customers will use it and ideally pay for it, then you can approach seed investors.<\/p>\n<p>The term \u201cseed\u201d refers to startups in the earlier stages \u2014 more than just an idea, but not yet a fully developed business. Seed investors may be professionals who spend all their time investing and helping their investments to succeed. Or they may be \u201cangels\u201d who often have another full-time occupation but invest in startups as a pastime and a passion. Smart seed investors look at a lot of potential startups for every one investment they actually make. They\u2019ll know to ask tough questions and dig into your data, so you need to be prepared.<\/p>\n<p>Many entrepreneurs dream about raising venture capital. Venture capital generally comes from firms \u2014 groups of professionals that specialize in finding promising companies ready to grow rapidly, making investments in those companies \u2014 often over a number of years \u2014 then helping those companies grow as fast as possible. Venture capitalists will often need to see a mature product and compelling evidence that you have a great way to make a lot of money and grow very quickly.<\/p>\n<p>As a simple rule of thumb, friends and family invest in you and your idea. Seed investors invest in your process of experimentation to find a great business model. Venture capitalists invest in great business models to help them grow.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there are other types of capital that might work for you, depending on your product.<\/p>\n<p>Some products work great for crowdfunding through sites like KickStarter or IndieGoGo.<\/p>\n<p>Borrowing money from banks might work for other types of solutions.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019re confident that your business is ready to raise a particular type of capital, then you really need to work to develop your pitch, or the story you tell investors about your business model and how you will grow a big business quickly. While you\u2019re developing your pitch \u2014 which should take weeks or even months of diligent practice to get right \u2014 you should also be connecting with potential investors. A great way to engage an investor is to let them know you\u2019ll be raising soon, but would like to start by getting their advice. This gives them an opportunity to get to know you over time and signal their interest before a formal pitch.<\/p>\n<p>Once your business is ready, your pitch is strong, and you\u2019re confident that you have a good pool of interested investors, then you actually go forward with a formal capital raise. The raise itself may only take a few weeks to a few months, but the overall process of raising capital should take as long as six months to do right.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve completed the course, please visit YALI.STATE.GOV to take the quiz. This will help you test your knowledge and earn credit towards a special certificate.<\/p>\n<p>[TEXT: TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE YALI.STATE.GOV]<\/p>\n<p>[TEXT: YALI NETWORK PRODUCED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE]<\/p>\n',

What is customer acquisition?]<\/p>\n<p>[TEXT: Evan Burfield, Co-Founder, 1776]<\/p>\n<p>Growing your business.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s going to be three learning objectives in this module.<\/p>\n<p>\uf0b7 What is product-market fit?<\/p>\n<p>\uf0b7 How do you scale your business?<\/p>\n<p>\uf0b7 And what is customer acquisition?<\/p>\n<p>Every startup founder dreams of world domination \u2014 the kind of explosive growth that takes you from a dream to million or billions of people using your product around the world.<\/p>\n<p>Rapid growth is rarely about just \u201cstriking gold\u201d though, and much more about developing the right processes. Before you can grow, you have to have a product that users love and with the ability to generate enough revenue to make a profit, ideally a large profit.<\/p>\n<p>Finding a business model that works is often referred to as finding \u201cproduct-market fit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There are lots of great products and lots of juicy markets, but to grow fast you have to have found the right product for the right market.<\/p>\n<p>The Lean Startup Methodology is one popular way that successful startup founders go through the process of finding product-market fit. A \u201clean startup\u201d approach to building your business pairs an iterative, experimental approach to developing an in depth understanding of your customers \u2014 and their needs and wants \u2014 with a fast, flexible approach to building your product. The idea is that you build as little of your product as possible, test it with real customers, then make quick tweaks and changes to the product, and repeat.<\/p>\n<p>One important rule of thumb is that it\u2019s much easier to iterate and refine toward product-market fit at small scale than once you\u2019ve started to grow. There are simply fewer variables and less<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re growing the right business model before you spend a significant amount of capital on scaling it. Strong evidence of product-market fit might be as simple as several hundred active users or a few key enterprise clients, but it might also require more extensive testing and growth to really validate your model.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have product-market fit, the next challenge becomes growing your business.<\/p>\n<p>There are many aspects to growing a business from a few co-founders with a small group of early adopter customers into a huge global operation. The primary challenge, however, is finding a repeatable customer acquisition model. In other words, you need to get really, really efficient at finding profitable customers for your product.<\/p>\n<p>In the early days of your startup, your early adopter customers may very well come from the hustle, networks and charisma of the founding team. There\u2019s an inevitable limit as to how big you can grow with all of your customers coming from people the founders know. At some point, you need to start experimenting and refining the way in which you\u2019ll find, keep and grow<\/p>\n<p>Depending on how much revenue you\u2019ll get from each individual sale or customer relationship, and the nature of your relationship with your customers, the ways you find, keep and grow customers will look different.<\/p>\n<p>If your customers are big corporations with each sale representing hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in revenue \u2014 with each customer requiring a lot of attention, then you\u2019ll probably hire sales people who will spend time in person with customers working to develop the relationship and close sales. If you\u2019re selling a mobile app to consumers, with each user representing a few dollars per year in revenue, then you\u2019ll almost certainly need to find your customers online, with zero direct interaction between your team and your customers. If you\u2019re somewhere in between \u2014 perhaps you\u2019re selling an online tool for small businesses, who each pay you $1,000 per year, then you may look toward a model where you\u2019re finding potential customers online but then having less expensive sales people call then on the phone to turn those potential customers into actual customers.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, you\u2019ll need to work hard to refine your model to make it as efficient as possible, so the capital you raise for growth can take you as far as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve completed the course, please visit YALI.STATE.GOV to take the quiz.

You will also learn how to raise additional funds, and how to move beyond your comfort zone.<\/p>\n<p>Many small businesses struggle to achieve growth, and more than a third of all startups fail within two years. For those of you who have built a successful small business, you want to know how to grow your business and when to grow beyond its current level.<\/p>\n<p>When Is the Right Time to Expand Your Business?<\/p>\n<p>Growth is key to the success of any startup, but the best type of growth is one that is carefully thought through and planned out. Sometimes growing too fast without proper planning can harm and even destroy a business. So before you undertake any major growth initiatives, like launching a new product or opening a new store, you must first understand the future of the industry.<\/p>\n<p>Ask yourself whether demand for your products or services are growing, what your competitors are doing, and whether you can continue to meet your customers\u2019 demands at the same level of service. Quality of service often drops when businesses start expanding too fast, which can impact your brand\u2019s reputation.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes you need to spend money to make money. Before expanding your business, you should evaluate whether you can raise enough capital to make the jump.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, never forget what got you started in your business: your entrepreneurial dream. This is a new challenge for you, so it\u2019s important to believe in yourself. Trust your good judgment for when to seize opportunities and grow.<\/p>\n<p>Now, how do you grow your business? Here are four quick ideas to help you with your business<\/p>\n<p>One: Open another location. This will allow you to reach a new demographic and give you exposure in an area that did not know you existed, but needs your product and services.<\/p>\n<p>Two: Diversify. Diversifying your product or service line is an excellent growth strategy because it allows you to have multiple streams of income. When I started my organization, we were focused exclusively on delivering water services. We have since diversified to include sanitation and hygiene promotion services, which provides different opportunities for us to raise funds.<\/p>\n<p>Three: Win a government contract. One of the best ways to grow your business is to have the government as a customer. In most countries, the government is the largest buyer of goods and services, and some even require their various agencies to allocate a certain percentage of their purchase to local businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Four: Expand to the Internet. Having a Web presence is an integral part in today\u2019s business environment. It also serves as an online storefront and acts as the conveyer of your business\u2019 brand and message to the world. Expanding your business to the Internet allows you to indirectly go global with your products and services.<\/p>\n<p>How to Raise Funds to Grow Your Business.<\/p>\n<p>Getting your business to the next stage is never easy, and you will more than likely need some capital. It is important not to limit yourself and get creative. In addition to angel investors and traditional bank loans, there are many potential sources of funds such as crowdfunding, business incubators, competitions and small business grants.<\/p>\n<p>Moving Beyond Your Comfort Zone.<\/p>\n<p>No matter which sector you are in, networking is the fastest track to success and puts you in a position to meet the right people who can help you fundraise and deliver results. It is important to expand your horizon and move beyond your immediate network of friends and acquaintances and build a wider, global network of supporters and funders.<\/p>\n<p>Taking a small business to the next level requires hard work, perseverance, risk and a good product or service \u2013 they are all key to growing your startup.<\/p>\n<p>After you\u2019ve completed all the units in this course, at YALI.state.gov, you can test your knowledge and earn a YALI Network certificate.<\/p>\n<p>[TEXT: Test your knowledge]<\/p>\n<p>[TEXT: YALI Network Produced by the U.S. Department of State]<\/p>\n',
